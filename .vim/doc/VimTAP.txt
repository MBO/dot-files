					    *VimTAP*

VimTAP is an implementation of the Test Anything Protocol for Vim. It is
intended to provide an easy way to test your Vim scripts and functions.

TAP is widely used by the Perl community. To its main features count the
easy way of reading test protocols manually and the independence of
producers and consumers of the test protocol data.

==============================================================================

1. The Plan				    *vimtap#Plan*

vimtap#Plan(number_of_tests)

Never do something without a plan! The plan tells the harness how many
tests should be run. In this way it is easy to know, when your script
stop somewhere in the middle.

TAP allows the plan also to follow the actual test output, but this
should be rarely needed. Providing the plan beforehand is better. >

	" Plan to run 4 tests.
	call vimtap#Plan(4)
<
==============================================================================

2. Ok: the simple way			    *vimtap#Ok*

vimtap#Ok(test_result, description)

The simplest way to do a test, is to use Ok. It is most suitable for some
kind of predicate or some complicated calculation. However, since it only
sees the result, Ok cannot tell you, why the result is like it is.

The description (as it maybe given to any test function) is used to identify
the test in the output. >

	call vimtap#Ok(x == y, "x is equal to y")
	call vimtap#Ok(IsFoo(x), "x is Foo")
<
==============================================================================

3. Is: more information			    *vimtap#Is*

vimtap#Is(got, expected, description)

Is does not take the result, but does the comparison of the actual value
against the expected one. This gives Is the possibility to be more verbose
than Ok in case the test fails. Then it prints the expected value as well
as the actual one in order to give the developer more hints, why the test
actually failed. >

	call vimtap#Is(x, "good value", "x is a good value")
<
==============================================================================

4. Isnt: turn the tides			    *vimtap#Isnt*

vimtap#Isnt(got, unexpected, description)

Sometimes there are values, which you don't want to see as a result of a
computation. This can be tested with Isnt. The actual value has to be
different from the given reference value for the test to succeed. >

	call vimtap#Isnt(x, "bad value", "x is not a bad value")
<
==============================================================================

5. Like: more fuzziness needed?		    *vimtap#Like*

vimtap#Like(got, regular expression, description)

When you don't expect a certain value, but a result of a certain structure
you can also use Like to test the result against a given regular expression. >

	call vimtap#Like(x, '^\d$', "x is a digit")
<
==============================================================================

6. Unlike				    *vimtap#Unlike*

vimtap#Unlike(got, regular expression, description)

As with Is and Isnt, you might want to test, that a result doesn't contain
some unwanted anti-patterns. >

	call vimtap#Unlike(x, '^\s*$', "x does contain non-whitespace")
<
==============================================================================

7. Diag: It hurts, Doctor!		    *vimtap#Diag*

vimtap#Diag(diagnostic message)

From time to time one may want to print some diagnostic output. This has to
be prefixed by '#' to conform to TAP. But Diag to the rescue: it takes of
this for you. >

	call vimtap#Diag("Testing now this and that feature...")
<
Note: For now \n, \r and \r\n are all considered to delimit lines.
